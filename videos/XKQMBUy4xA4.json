Thanks for joining today's very special stream. Mental health issues are under-diagnosed and under-treated, which is why we're fundraising to support research that aims to discover more about the brain and to develop better treatments for mental illnesses. As some of you may know, we lost our longest-running editor and good friend Ronnie to suicide earlier this year. Since then, we've wanted to use our voice and platform to bring more awareness to this issue. Mental illness affects a huge number of people, many of whom feel they can't talk about it or can't find effective treatment. YOU CAN HELP RIGHT NOW by clicking the Donate Button and giving toward our goal of $175,000. We can get there with your help!\n\nToday we're raising money for the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation. They strive to alleviate the suffering caused by mental illness. EVERY DOLLAR YOU DONATE GOES STRAIGHT TO RESEARCH. None of your donation goes to overhead or administration, it all goes where it can help the most.
